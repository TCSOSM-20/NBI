roles:

##
# This file defines the mapping between user roles and operation permissions.
# It uses the following pattern:
#
#    - name: <ROLE_NAME>
#      permissions:
#        "<OPERATION>": true | false
#
# <ROLE_NAME> defines the name of the role. This name will be matched with an
# existing role in the RBAC system (e.g. keystone).
#
# NOTE: The role will only be used if there is an existing match. If there
#       isn't a role in the system that can be matched, the operation permissions
#       won't yield any result.
#
# permissions: is a dictionary of operation permissions for the role. An operation
# permission is defined using the following pattern:
#
#    "<OPERATION>": true | false
#
# The operations are defined using an hierarchical tree. For this purpose, an
# <OPERATION> tag can represents the path for the following:
#    - default:  what action to be taken by default, allow or deny
#    - admin: allow or deny usin querey string ADMIN to act on behalf of other project
#    - colon separated hierarchical tree
#
# The default and admin <OPERATION> tag is considered false if missing.
# When you use this tag, all the operation permissions will be set to the value
# assigned.
# NOTE 1: The default value is false. So if a value isn't specified, it will
#         default to false.
# NOTE 2: The default <OPERATION> tag can be overridden by using more specific tags
#         with a different value.
#
# The 'force', 'public' and 'set_project' operation tags (respectively allowing/denying
# the use of the query-strings FORCE, PUBLIC and SET_PROJECT), take by default the
# value specified by the tag 'default' (false if not specified).
#
# The node <OPERATION> tag is defined by using an internal node of the tree, i.e.
# "nsds", "users:id". A node <OPERATION> tag will affect all the nodes and leafs
# beneath it. It can be used to override a default <OPERATION> tag.
# NOTE 1: It can be overridden by using a more specific tag, such as a node which
#         is beneath it or a leaf.
#
# The leaf <OPERATION> tag is defined by using a leaf of the tree, i.e. "users:post",
# "ns_instances:get", "vim_accounts:id:get". A leaf <OPERATION> tag will override all
# the values defined by the parent nodes, since it is the more specific tag that can
# exist.
#
# General notes:
#    - In order to find which tags are in use, check the resources_to_operations.yml.
#    - In order to find which roles are in use, check the RBAC system.
#    - Non existing tags will be ignored.
#    - Tags finishing in a colon will be ignored.
#    - The anonymous role allows to bypass the role definition for paths that
#      shouldn't be verified.
